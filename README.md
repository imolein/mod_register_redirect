# mod_register_redirect
I publish the fixed version of [mod_register_redirect](https://modules.prosody.im/mod_register_redirect.html) (which is working with Prosody >=0.10) on github, because I don't know how I can commit changes to the prosody-modules repository, because of the lack of documentation about it.

### Change in this version
I only changed line 9 from
`local cman = configmanager`
to
`local cman = require "core.configmanager"`

(and a type in README.markdown ;-) )
